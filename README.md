## Love ClickHouse, but not the complexity?

[Tinybird](https://tinybird.co) is a managed, serverless ClickHouse for developers; never worry about infrastructure, scale, or integration. Ingest data directly over HTTPS, from Kafka, or from your Warehouse; write your logic in SQL; and publish the result of your SQL as REST APIs at the click of a button. [You can use Tinybird for free, with no time limit.](https://tinybird.co)

## Development

This website is built using [Docusaurus 2](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.

### Installation

```bash
cd knowledge-base
npm install
```

or

```bash
yarn
```

### Local Development

```bash
cd knowledge-base
npm start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

### Build

```bash
cd knowledge-base
npm run build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.
